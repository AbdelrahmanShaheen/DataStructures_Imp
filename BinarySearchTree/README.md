# This is **a binary search tree** impelementation using `classes` for encapsulation.
 A binary search tree (BST), which may sometimes also be called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the 
 following properties: 
 1) The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key. 
 2) The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key. 
 3) Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

## Methods and Usages :

* ```RInsert``` : insert a node in recursive order.

* ```IterativeSearch``` : insert a node in iterative order. 

* ```RSearch``` : search for a node recursively.

* ```InOrder``` : print all nodes in inorder traversal.

* ```Delete``` : delete a node.

* ```Height``` : find the height of a tree or subtree.

* ```InSucc``` : search for inorder successor node(it is used when you want to  delete a node).

* ```InPre``` : search for inorder predecessor node(it is used when you want to  delete a node).
